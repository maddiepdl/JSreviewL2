JSreviewL2: Fortune-Teller assignment using JavaScript functions

ðŸ“¦ Installation

# fortuneTeller(name, age) function takes the user's name and age inputs, and returns a fortune message based on rules applied to both the name and age.
## The name rules depend on the number of characters of the name, if it starts with R, and if it includes i. Javascript is case-sensitive so I included name.toLowerCase()
### The age rule depends on if the user is under 18, between 18 and 30, or greater than 30.
